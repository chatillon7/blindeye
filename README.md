# Blind Eye
Is an application that allows people with low self-confidence or who are shy about meeting to take a step, gives them the chance to socialize, and does not rely on flattery.

"Are you having trouble making friends or can't read someone's intentions, is it boring to be alone while studying, are you tired of being alone while playing games?"
If these questions apply to you, this app will help people who feel this way take action.
